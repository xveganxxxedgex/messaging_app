# Messaging App

This is a proof-of-concept project showcasing a simple chatting application.

This project meets the following criteria:

- Sample/mock API responses to load contact list, messages and POSTing a new message.
- Router supporting different routes when viewing contact list and chat histories.
- Desktop and mobile views.

**Note**: New messages are only saved locally temporarily and will be cleared on page navigations.
